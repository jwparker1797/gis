# Why Programming?
When I started learning GIS in school, I did not understand programming...I didn't even know what programming or software development was. This was not all bad. I was able to dedicate time to really understanding spatial concepts, map making, and Error code 99999. 

Eventually you will stop wanting to do the boring tasks of a GIS Tech, as I did. This is probably why you are here reading this blog. Or maybe, you want to create new tools for coworkers, custom widgets for web apps, or even full custom web mapping applications for your customer. Fantastic! You have come to the right place for a jumping off point.

If you learn by doing, like me, this blog will should work really well for you. I do not intend to hold hands, but I will give you learning paths and resources that I have found useful in my self-taught studies.
