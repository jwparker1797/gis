# Why Programming?
When I started learning GIS in school, I did not understand programming...I didn't even know what programming or software development was. This was not all bad. I was able to dedicate time to really understanding spatial concepts, map making, and Error code 99999. 

Eventually you will stop wanting to do the boring tasks of a GIS Tech, as I did. This is probably why you are here reading this blog. Or maybe, you want to create new tools for coworkers, custom widgets for web apps, or even full custom web mapping applications for your customer. Fantastic! You have come to the right place for a jumping off point.

If you learn by doing, like me, this blog will should work really well for you. I do not intend to hold hands, but I will give you learning paths and resources that I have found useful in my self-taught studies.


# Things you can do with GIS programming skills

## - Automate Tasks and Workflows
If you're new to programming, this is where you want to start. Think of a task you do everyday on your computer...that you find really boring...preferably a GIS task. This is your first project after you learn the basics.

A good book to start learning Python that many people recommend is [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) by [Al Sweigart](https://twitter.com/AlSweigart). (BTW, click that link. The book is there for FREE!). This will book will not only walk you through the syntax, but also give you a good idea on how powerful Python (and programming in general) can be.

## - Process Data

## - Create Applications

## - Modify Existing Application Behaviors
