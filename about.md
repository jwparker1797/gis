I am a professional GIS {title} with many years experience delivering a variety of Geographic Information System solutions to government and commercial clients.

I started off as a technician digitizing wetlands at a non-profit with no experience in developing or creating software.

I was shown the power of Python and realized I could Automate the Boring Stuff and focus on the fun aspects of GIS work (like making maps!).

This lead me to self-teach myself through a variety of programming languages and technologies.

If you are a GIS Tech or Analyst and are wanting to learn more programming, this might be the place for you! If you have suggestions for blog posts or tutorials, let me know and I will do my best to post something for you!
